Read processing and variant calling were executed by the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC; CFAES Analytical Services, The Ohio State University). 
Illumina paired-end reads generated across multiple lanes per library were processed with the nf-core/sarek (Hanssen et al., 2024) workflow version 3.5.1. Initial QC was done with FastQC version 0.12.1, (Andrews, 2010) and adapters/low-quality tails (auto adapter/polyG; reads dropped if >40% bases have <Q15, >5 Ns, or length <15 bp) were trimmed using fastp version 0.23.4 (Shifu Chen et al., 2018). The pipeline then put together files for each sample, and a MultiQC version 1.27.1 (Ewels et al., 2016) report summarized QC across all libraries. Cleaned reads were aligned to the Taraxacum kok- saghyz reference genome OSU_TarKok_2.0 (GenBank assembly: GCA_047496595.1)   diploid inbred individual therefore the assembly is haploid  1,2 flo cytometry in annograms vs 1.25, 9 pseudomolecule and small contigs that might be inflating the size. 
with BWA-MEM2 version 0.7.18 (Vasimuddin Md et al., n.d.), followed by coordinate sorting, duplicate marking, and index creation. Because validated known-sites sets are not yet available for TK, base quality score recalibration was not applied.
Germline variant discovery was performed following Sarek’s recommended pipeline GATK HaplotypeCaller version 4.5.0.0  (Poplin et al., 2018) that produced per-sample Variant Call Format files (gVCFs) (Danecek et al., 2011), which were merged by joint genotyping to obtain a cohort VCF file containing SNPs and short indels suitable for downstream filtering and population genetic analyses
